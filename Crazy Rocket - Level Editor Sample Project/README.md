This project is a sample of a fully working level editor I've created for my game "Crazy Rocket"

Even though it is a fully working editor, it was not made with the purpose to be used by other people, so the code is a bit messy. I'd advise to only use this project as help / reference on how you could continue past the tutorial series. Keep in mind that there were a lot of modifications done to the version in the tutorials to make it a better product, and to make the code easier to read. 

If I were to create this level editor again I'd do things differently, so do not consider this as a finished product, it really isn't. It could use a lot of optimizations and quality of life changes, for both the users and developers.
